1. Planning
Description: This is the initial phase where teams define project requirements, objectives, and scope. It involves stakeholder meetings, user story creation, and roadmap development.

Purpose:

Establish clear goals and deliverables.
Align on project scope and requirements.
Define timelines and resource allocation.
Activities:

Requirement gathering and analysis.
Sprint planning and backlog creation.
Roadmap and milestone setting.
2. Development
Description: During this phase, developers write and commit code to the source repository. This stage focuses on coding, creating new features, and fixing bugs.

Purpose:

Build and modify the application according to the requirements.
Maintain code quality and functionality.
Activities:

Writing and reviewing code.
Creating documentation.
Implementing features and bug fixes.
3. Continuous Integration (CI)
Description: Continuous Integration involves merging code changes into a shared repository frequently. Automated build and test processes are triggered with each commit to ensure code changes integrate smoothly.

Purpose:

Detect and address integration issues early.
Ensure code quality and functionality through automated testing.
Activities:

Automated builds triggered by code commits.
Running unit tests and integration tests.
Code analysis and quality checks.
4. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
Description: Continuous Delivery extends CI by automating the deployment process to ensure that code changes are ready for production. Continuous Deployment takes it a step further by automatically deploying code to production environments.

Purpose:

Enable rapid and reliable releases.
Reduce manual intervention in the deployment process.
Activities:

Automated deployment pipelines.
Deployment to staging and production environments.
Configuration management.
5. Testing
Description: This phase involves rigorous testing to ensure the application performs as expected. Testing can include unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

Purpose:

Validate that the application meets the specified requirements.
Identify and fix defects before release.
Activities:

Running automated and manual tests.
Performing performance and security testing.
Conducting user acceptance testing (UAT).
6. Release
Description: The release phase is where the application is formally launched to the production environment. It involves final preparations and ensuring that the release is smooth and successful.

Purpose:

Deploy the application to end users.
Ensure a smooth and controlled release process.
Activities:

Release management and coordination.
Final verification and validation.
Post-release monitoring and support.
7. Monitoring
Description: Continuous monitoring involves tracking the application’s performance and behavior in real-time. This includes logging, metrics collection, and alerting to detect and address issues promptly.

Purpose:

Ensure the application is performing as expected.
Detect and respond to issues quickly.
Activities:

Implementing monitoring tools and dashboards.
Analyzing logs and performance metrics.
Setting up alerts for anomalies and failures.
8. Feedback
Description: Feedback is gathered from various sources, including users, monitoring tools, and team retrospectives. This feedback is used to identify areas for improvement and guide future development efforts.

Purpose:

Continuously improve the application and development process.
Address user feedback and operational insights.
Activities:

Collecting user feedback and bug reports.
Analyzing feedback from monitoring and support.
Conducting retrospectives and process reviews.
9. Maintenance
Description: The maintenance phase involves ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to ensure the application remains functional and relevant over time. This includes managing technical debt and adapting to changes in the environment.

Purpose:

Keep the application up-to-date and operational.
Address issues and enhance features as needed.
Activities:

Applying patches and updates.
Refactoring code and managing technical debt.
Implementing new features and improvements.
